# fastai-walkthru

## Introduction
Following a coding session by Jeremy Howard on YouTube for fastai.
#### Notes:
 - Always use mamba or conda to install program.
 - While installing Pytorch even though it shows conda is not suported in the pytorch documentation, use mamba.There will be less conflict if you use mamba or conda while installing Pytorch.
- if you are following through the video then in the live coding 2, they use fastchan as downloading channel but it does not work so use fastai.
